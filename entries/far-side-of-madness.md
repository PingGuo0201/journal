# The Far Side of Madness

Having a mind that sometimes [goes manic](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/mentalhealtherror-an-exception-occurred) is an interesting burden to bear — I have to question my own senses  and sensibilities on a regular basis. I have to be very careful to remain mindful, get enough sleep, and remain balanced in all areas of life (as does anyone, but to a more extreme degree).

The longer I go without an episode, though, the less this is the case. This mechanism becomes more automatic.

But I don't think I'll ever fully "let go" and just trust that everything will be fine — I'll always have a part of me that's double-checking my boundaries and my reality to confirm that it is within the boundaries of what is considered normal.

I wonder if that's healthy?

I think it is.
