# Pipe Dream: Making a Game

I started working on writing code as a young kid for one reason — I wanted
to write games.

Text adventure games, to be exact. I never got around to it.

I want to do that, one day. I'm not sure what a game I'd make would look like,
what platform I'd chose, or anything of the sort.

All I know is that I want to do all the graphics, all the music, and (maybe)
all the programming. That is something I'd be proud of.
