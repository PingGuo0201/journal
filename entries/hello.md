First Entry
===========

This is the first entry of my public journal.

I like this concept. I think that it is a powerful one; to share inner thoughts and feelings towards the world in a digestable format. This content doesn't exactly belong on my blog, but it belongs somewhere. 

I think this is a good place for random philisophical musings.
