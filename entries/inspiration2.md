# Seeking Inspiration, Somewhere

Lately, I've found myself a bit *stuck* when it comes to sources of
inspiration.

This has manifested itself in my music, my coding, and my photography.

I don't like being in this place. I'm searching for something, but I don't
know what it is.

I just want something to really sink my teeth into, and am not finding it.

Maybe this upcoming PyCon 2017 will shake things up enough to rid me of this ailment.
