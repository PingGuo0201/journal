# On Psychedelics and Other Drugs

I used to be a big proponent of legalization for all psychedelics drugs.
I am not anymore.

I wonder sometimes if I actually have bipolar disorder, or if I've simply
experienced the long-term side-effects of experimenting with those substances.

I only experimented for "spiritual" reasons, never to get "fucked up". I didn't
do these things often. I did Ayahuasca, for example.

They altered my perception, though. And not for the better, I'd say.

I don't do drugs anymore. I haven't in a long time.

I'm now pro decriminalization, not legalization. A part of me feels like
the law is there to protect me from these substances, and other people
like me.

I know, historically, that doesn't seem to be the case, but that doesn't mean
that perhaps the laws aren't somewhat helpful in this regard.
