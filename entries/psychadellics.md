# On Psychedelics and Other Drugs

I used to be a big proponent of legalization for all psychedelics drugs.
I am not anymore.

I wonder sometimes if I actually have bipolar disorder, or if I've simply
experienced the long-term side-effects of experimenting with those substances.

I experimented with Ayhuasca, Amanita Muscaria, Cannabis, Psilocybin, Hash, and LSD.

I only experimented for "spiritual" reasons, never to get "fucked up".

I didn't do these things often (other than the non-illegal Amanitas).

They altered my perception, though.
