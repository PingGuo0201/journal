# My Favorite Python Libraries

Here is a concise list of some of my favorite Python modules:

- [Parse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parse). It's the opposite of format.
- [Docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt). It's the opposite of argparse.
- [Alabaster](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), as it empowers me to empower other developers.
- [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/), as it doubly empowers me to empower other developers.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), for obvious reasons.

Some that I've written myself:

- [Crayons](https://github.com/kennethreitz/crayons), the best terminal colors library around.
- [Pipenv](http://pipenv.org), as it saves me hours of time.
- [Requests](http://python-requests.org), for obvious reasons.
