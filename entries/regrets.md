# Living With Reasonable Regrets

I do my best to live life without regrets. When I sit down and think of
things in my life I regret, I can think of *almost* nothing, which is good!

I think everyone should live their life this way.

There are things I wish I hadn't done though — like build [Maya: Timestamps for Humans](https://github.com/kennethreitz/maya), or [Pipenv](http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/). This isn't because I
regret these libraries/tools, but because they were so much fun to build!

I want to build them again.

That's what I'm missing from my life right now — a project to hack on. If
I hadn't have built those things already, I'd have plenty to work on right now!

I certinaly have no regrets, but sometimes I wish my past self was a little less productive.
