# It's About Time...

It's about time for me to produce another heavily-used and well-loved Python library.

Yet, I have nothing planned. I've built all that I want to build, for the time being.

It's about time that I built something new for myself, to give me something to do.

Yet, there is nothing I currently want to build.

I have the desire to have a desire to code furiously into the night on *something*,
but it seems that I've hit some open-source developer's form of writer's block...

So, I'm writing instead.
