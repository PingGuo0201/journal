# On Traveling and Depression

Over the past year, I've been struggling a bit with depression, for the first time in my life.

It took me a while to realize it, but this is also the first time (in quite a while) that I have taken a break from traveling.

I think the two are correlated.

I live in a small town, and don't have much of a social life locally. Spending too much time at home seems to really get me down, after a while.

Just an interesting observation.
