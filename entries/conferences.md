# On Conferences and Travel

I'm currently en-route to PyCon 2017, and I couldn't be more excited. This is my fifth year attending PyCon, and each year seems to be better than the last.

I used to attend almost every Python conference around, but I make a point to mostly only go to PyCon US now. Why is that?

Well, to be honest, I *over-traveled* myself out quite a bit. At my peak, I was attending ~4 conferences per month for about 3 solid years (all paid for by my company). This proved to be far too much.

One day, I woke up in Bangalore, India, and decided that enough was enough, and that I wanted to go home. 

My sense of home was at conferences, and living out of a backpack, not at my home back in Virginia. Now, I have roots in Virginia. Family. I did then too, but they were being ignored. 

I guess what I'm saying is, conferences are great - some of the best social interactions and friendships I've ever developed were from conferences. But, too much is still too much.
