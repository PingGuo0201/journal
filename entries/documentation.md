# Writing Reasonable Documentation

I find it strange that most people seem to be rather horrible at writing documentation. While this is simply a subjective opinion of mine (who am I to say that I am any better than *they*), it is one that many of my colleagues share.

Writing documentation, once you're in the mood for it, is quite easy. You simply explain how to understand/use a piece of software in a concise, mildly entertaining fashion.

- Don't explain everything - leave some mystery. 
- Explain what needs to be explained, and get on with it. 
- Show some examples. 
- Expect people to skip over most large blocks of text, so avoid them entirely.

Ideally, the software does a good job of explaining itself. If not, you may want to consider a new approach to your design (or accept the complications of your codebase's territory).

That's the best advice I can give to anyone trying to write better documentation (if they consider mine to be of any merit, that is).
