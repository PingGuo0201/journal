# Fellowship at PyCon (upcomming)

PyCon 2017 is coming up next week, and I couldn't be more excited about it.
It's the one time of the year I get to see many of my closest friends and
spend a whole week with them, catching up, and living a slightly different
life than usual.

A lot of people won't be there this year, which makes me sad, but it's always
a challenge to see everyone anyway.

I have a feeling I'll be a little less social this year than usual. Certianly,
I'll be plenty social, but PyCon is normally for me an *over-abundance* of
social activity, compared to the rest of the year, combined. This year, I see
it being a bit more balanced and relaxed. Taking some time by myself in
addition to all the wonderful social chaos it introduces.

I'm really looking forward to it.
