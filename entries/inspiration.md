On Inspiration and Tools (like languages)
=========================================

I often find myself inspired by the tools that I use. Today's example is
a collection of VSTs made available from
[KORG Gadget for Mac](http://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_gadget/for_mac.php).

Any artist can make due with any tools he has at his disposal — any camera, any lens,
any synthesizer, any computer or editor (if he's writing code). I find myself,
however, drawing the majority of my inspiration from other tools I love.

I mostly build tools myself, you see, so I guess I need to be surrounded by
things I wish I had built myself, in order to be in the right mindset.

I could certinaly create with anything that was made available to me, not
the best of my favorite of any tool — but it certinaly wouldn't be the same
for me. I wouldn't be enjoying myself.

That's why I develop software in Python. It inspires me.

Why do you use your programming language of choice?
