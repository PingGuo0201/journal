# Three Concise Truths

Three concise things you'll rarely find my saying, but are personally true:

— I have great faith, and share the core faiths of many religions (and enjoy the core message/study of their teachers, prophets, and perspectives), but find most people of the religions themselves to be of great distaste — even Bahai, the group that claims to have all the answers, and appears to be closest to truth. Their followers, that I've met so far, are close-minded individuals, who accept only what they've been taught.
— My ex is a bad person, with a good heart, on a very dark path.
— The new iPhone X brings me more joy than any of the above.
