# The Secret to My Success: Stimulants

Often, people ask me what the secret to my success is â€” meaning, they want to
know how I manage to produce so much open source code and be so productive
with my time.

The answer is multi-faceted, but one of the biggest factors is that of *caffeine*.

Whenever I'm in a particularly productive cycle, you'll see me pounding away
Red Bull, coffee, or Monster like there's no tomorrow. It's something I've
always done, and it serves me greatly.

I also have a history (in the past) of abusing my sleeping schedule, so I can
get things done.

You may notice that both of these behaviors are symptomatic of either Bipolar
Disorder or ADD. In either case, you would be correct, I am diagnosed with both.

Today, I take Vyvanse daily, which helps me tremendously with executive function.
In addition to that, I drink a moderate amount of caffeine throught the day, and
am able to produce a steady amount of work almost constantly.

Why am I sharing this? Why not. I think it's important to talk about these things.

Caffeine (and other stimulants) work for me. There wouldn't be a Requests if I
didn't use these substances. I think that's interesting.
