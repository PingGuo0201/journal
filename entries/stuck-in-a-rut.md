# Stuck in a Rut

I'm stuck in a rut.

I'm very happy, but I feel unfufilled. Nothing that I create lately is bringing
me any joy, other than this writing — and even it seems frivolous. Enough so
to not share it.

Am I depressed? I don't feel depressed, but perhaps I am.

Depression is a tricky thing — especially when it manifests like this. For, I
am truly happy and very blessed at this time. Nothing is going wrong.

Yet, somehow, nothing feels quite right either.

I just need a break from the monotony of the day-to-day, perhaps. PyCon 2017
is coming up soon, and should provide some much needed social stimulation to
my life.

I'm so content, so happy, yet so... empty right now.

I just want to create something I'm proud of. That hasn't happened in a little while.

I'm proud of this journal, strangely enough. It makes me happy.
