# Positivity, Coming Soon™

I'm a big proponent of positivity. I do my best to avoid overly negative
people, and remove other sources of negativity from my life.

However, some of the posts in this journal seem rather un-positive. Why is that?

I'm trying my best to paint an accurate picture of my inner world, instead of
only presenting a single side of it to the reader, as I ussually do. I think
that's what journaling is all about — expressing both the good and the bad,
in an unfiltered manner.

Not to overshare, of course.

So, shortly, there should be many more exciting posts shared.

'tis the ebb & flow of life. Riding with the tides.
