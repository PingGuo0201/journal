# On Writing Music and Emotional Landscape

My life is rather stable. I have nothing to complain about, and nothing
is urgently pressing against my emotional walls at the moment, or has been
in a while.

That's wonderful, but I've noticed that this has an unfortunate downside,
compared to the times when this wasn't the case — my music is suffering
because of it.

It's a little frustrating.

When I listen to my [two albums](https://www.kennethreitz.org/music/), I am
transported into a vast emotional landscape that is grand and immersive.

Now, when I write music, I'm just making pretty sounds.

Emotional stability, with the help of some medication, has it's costs I suppose.
