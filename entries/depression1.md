On Depression, Part I (of many)
===============================

I've been a bit depressed latelyâ€”not about anything imparticular, but I've simply run out of things to do in my spare time.

This is something I struggle with a lot, sometimes. It is known as *akathesia*. 

Hence, me working on this journal thing. It's simply something to do. 

There's no harm in that, certianly.
