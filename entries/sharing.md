Sharing is Theraputic
=====================

Sharing things (in this case, online) is a very theraputic exercise.

When I wrote my rather emberassing [blog post](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/mentalhealtherror-an-exception-occurred) about being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder,
I was very surprised by the tremendous amount of positive feedback that I got from
my audience. I was sharing what is admittedly the most humiliating thing that could
possibly happen to me, and I heard back from the mob almost nothing but praise for
doing so.

I think people should share, in a thoughtful manner, more than they do. Essays
are an excellent way to share thoughts about things, but taken in the form of
a blog post, many topics aren't appropriate (e.g. "opinion peices") for the medium.

People should experiment with mediums more. Platforms seem to be driving our own
experimentation with sharing (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc), when really it
should be the other way around — people inherently want to share things about
themselves, and they should find the best way to do so for themselves.

This little method I've devised here is quite a good format for me, and I intend,
for the moment at least, to keep it. I encourage others to do the same, but in
whatever medium suits their minds.

Some of the most expressive people I know simply share photos of their artwork
on an occassional basis. That's exposing a lot more than some people realize.

I suppose, that's why I share so much [music on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/infinitestate) as well. They're little
snippets into my world and my mood — not so much amazingly produced works of art,
but little journal entries about what I'm going through. [My Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kennethreitz/) is likewise the same.

Little windows into a life, shared as a means of therapy.

If anyone has read this, I'd like to thank you for your attention. It's very
much valued and appreciated.
