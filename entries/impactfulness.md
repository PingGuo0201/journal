# On Open Source and Impactfulness

I often find myself caught in a web of thinking to myself "I must contribute code to the open source community that benefits the community". While this is fine and well, there's another side to this story -- one of my own mental health.

I have to admit that I often write code purely for my own benefit -- it gives me something to do in my free time, and is quite a bit of fun. Therefore, not all code I contribute needs to be either useful or even reasonable.

There's a balance between these two worlds. If you lean too far on either side, you'll get stuck in a rut of writing no code at all, or tons of nonsense no one will ever touch.
