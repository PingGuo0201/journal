# Competition and Open Source

One of the things I love the most about the open source world is the lack
of a feeling of competition. There's plenty of room for a new person to
come along on the scene and become popular and everyone's all the better
for it (assuming the software is good).

I don't understand why other fields in life aren't like this, particularly
music and photography. These fields are tremendously, feircely competitive,
and if anyone's getting any attention there it seems as though they're taking
away from the precious attention that you could be getting.

Is this purely because of market saturation? The open source world is very small, in comparison.

I'm not convinced.

Either way, I really like what we have going on in the open source world. I hope it stays that way.
