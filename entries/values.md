# A Concise List of Personal Values

One of my favorite pages of my website contains a short list of my personal
values — good, sometimes hard, lessons that I've learned in life.

- Positivity.
- 180° turns are encouraged.
- Listen to everyone, then disregard it.
- Optimize for peacefulness; in all directions.
- Life's not a race, but there's no speed limit either.
- Reality is what still exists after you stop believing in it.
- Always give the benefit of the doubt; don't forget red flags.
- There's a big difference between judgement and discernment.
- Negative atmospheres are toxic. Remove yourself from them.
- Attention is your only currency. Allocate it sparingly.
- Drink copious amounts of water—every day.
- Fallibilism (epistemological & moral).
- The best way to learn is to teach.
- Be cordial or be on your way.
- Be gentle with yourself.
- Inspire. Stay inspired.
- Never stop learning.
- Take breaks often.
- Keep breathing.

I love this list. I love iterating on it. I love improving it. I love adding new
things to it. I love maintaining it. I love when others see it.

I have no idea why.
