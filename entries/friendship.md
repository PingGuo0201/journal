On Friendship
=============

I have a good friend — perhaps that's a good term to use for this person — and he annoys me quite a bit. I generally enjoy his company, and we do spend a lot of time together.

However, he is quite young, and as such, does a number of things that I consider childish. Sometimes, I think he does these things to annoy me, even; but alas, he is just being his young self.

I don't think I'm better than him, by any means. I just think I'm better at being a people than he is.

Kind of fucked up, right?

I'm not so sure — he is a good friend, or rather, I consider him to be a friend, though perhaps I shouldn't.

I (very rarely) prefer to keep some people on short leashes, I suppose.
