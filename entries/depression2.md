# On Depression, Part II

Depression isn't want it seems, for me. 

It isn't an upsettedness about anything imparticular. It isn't a crippling feeling that the world is ending around me, or that I want to end my own life (although, I *have* experienced that terrible feeling before â€” brought on by medication). 

In a sense, my depression is simply an advanced form of *boredom*. Nothing really seems to peak my interest lately.

Come to think of it...that's kind of depressing. 

I get it now. :)
