# Dinner with a Narcissist

Lesson learned — don't do it.

I recently had the opportunity to reconnect with my [narcissistic](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/purging-the-unexpected-negative-a-narcissistic-partner) ex. She sent me a message (after I had accidentally unblocked her). We went for a walk, got dinner, and had a wonderful time.

What was not wonderful was the series of narcissistic abuse tactics that took place afterwards, as I attempted to communicate after the dinner was over. The dinner itself was sublime. But, needless to say, I was driven nearly mad by this woman.

So, if you're considering reconnecting with someone like this, my advice is simply—*don't do it*.

Fin.
